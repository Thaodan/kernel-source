Subject: [PATCH] dm: eliminate potential source of excessive kernel log noise
Git-commit: 0378c625afe80eb3f212adae42cc33c9f6f31abf
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc4
References: git fixes

There wasn't ever a real need to log an error in the kernel log for
ioctls issued with insufficient permissions. Simply return an error
and if an admin/user is sufficiently motivated they can enable DM's
dynamic debugging to see an explanation for why the ioctls were
disallowed.

Reported-by: Nir Soffer <nsoffer@redhat.com>
Fixes: e980f62353c6 ("dm: don't allow ioctls to targets that don't map to whole devices")
