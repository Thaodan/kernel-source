Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Always handle the VMBus messages on CPU0
Git-commit: 8a857c55420f29da4fc131adc22b12d474c48f4c
References: bsc#1204017

A Linux guest have to pick a "connect CPU" to communicate with the
Hyper-V host.  This CPU can not be taken offline because Hyper-V does
not provide a way to change that CPU assignment.

Current code sets the connect CPU to whatever CPU ends up running the
function vmbus_negotiate_version(), and this will generate problems if
that CPU is taken offine.

Establish CPU0 as the connect CPU, and add logics to prevents the
connect CPU from being taken offline.   We could pick some other CPU,
and we could pick that "other CPU" dynamically if there was a reason to
do so at some point in the future.  But for now, #defining the connect
CPU to 0 is the most straightforward and least complex solution.

While on this, add inline comments explaining "why" offer and rescind
messages should not be handled by a same serialized work queue.
